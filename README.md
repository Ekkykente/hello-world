# Hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow. 
I am a process system engineer interested in  applying data driven approaches to solving optimization problem and developing novel strategies for characterizing feasibility in integrated process trains.

I have great proficiency in using modelling and simulation tools such as Aspen HYSYS, GAMS, gPROMS, Matlab and Python
